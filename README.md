This repository contains the data and analyses of an experiment testing for host genotype by parasite genotype interactions in parasitic manipulation of host behavior. I have divided the analyses into two steps. First, in this [notebook](analyses/GxG_01_define_responses.md) I define the response variables for the analysis, looking for a reasonable balance between simplicity and information. Second, in this [notebook](analyses/GxG_02_genotype_comps.md) I look for host and parasite genotype interactions.
